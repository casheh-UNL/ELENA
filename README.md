# ELENA: EvaLuator of tunnElliNg Actions

A software for fast and precise computation of first order phase transitions and gravitational waves production in particle physics models.

## Overview

ELENA is an open-source Python package designed to compute the full evolution of first-order phase transitions in the early universe generated by particle physics models. Its core is based on a vectorized implementation of the tunnelling potential formalism, that allows a fast computation of the finite-temperature tunnelling action and of the resulting gravitational wave spectra.

## Features

- Fast computation of finite-temperature tunnelling actions using a vectorized implementation;
- Complete tracking of the evolution of first-order phase transitions;
- Computation of critical temperatures (nucleation, percolation, completion) in general cosmological settings;
- Gravitational waves spectrum calculation;
- Complete chain of computation from Lagrangian parameters to GW spectrum;

## Installation

ELENA is designed to be as much a self-contained Python package as possible, only requiring a small number of dependencies. To install it via `conda` simply run
```bash
conda create --name elena -c conda-forge python numpy scipy cosmoTransitions
conda activate elena
git clone https://github.com/michelelucente/ELENA
cd ELENA
```

This will create a minimal `conda` environment named `elena` where the code can be executed (ideal for scripted jobs).

In order to run the example notebooks some additional packaged are required. In this case the user can replace the first line above with

```bash
conda create --name elena -c conda-forge python numpy scipy cosmoTransitions matplotlib ipykernel natpy la_forge
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation about the ELENA and the related physics computations is available in the [companion paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00289).

## Quick Start
From the `./examples` directory run

```python
import sys
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Get the directory of the current script
script_dir = Path(os.getcwd()).resolve()

# Add the src directory to the Python path
sys.path.append(str(Path(script_dir / '../src').resolve()))

from utils import convert_units
from model import model
from espinosa import Vt_vec

# This selects a pair of couplings for which we expect a first-order phase transition over large intervals of vevs
lambda_ = 1.65e-3
g = 0.54
vev, units = 500, "MeV"

# This constructs the finite-temperature potential as an instance of the class model. 
dp = model(vev, lambda_, g, xstep= vev * 1e-3, Tstep=vev * 1e-3)
V = dp.DVtot # This is the scalar potential shifted such that the false vacuum is located at ϕ = 0 for each value of the temperature
dV = dp.gradV # This is the gradient of the scalar potential

T = 40 # Example temperature in the chosen units ("MeV")
instance = Vt_vec(T, V, dV, step_phi = 1e-3, precision = 1e-3, vev0 = vev, ratio_vev_step0=50) # Computation at temperature T

if instance.barrier:
    print(
    f"At T = {T} {units}: \n\n"
    f"S3/T = {instance.action_over_T:.2f}, \n"
    f"ϕ_true = {instance.true_min:.2f} {units}, \n"
    f"ϕ_false = {instance.phi_original_false_vev:.2f} {units}, \n"
    f"V(ϕ_true) = {instance.min_V:.2e} {units}^4, \n"
    f"ϕ_0 = {instance.phi0_min:.2f} {units}, \n"
    f"V(ϕ_0) = {instance.V_exit[0]:.2e} {units}^4."
)
else:
    print("No barrier found at this temperature.")
```

## Examples

See the [example notebook](./examples/phase_transition.ipynb) for a complete demonstration of the full phase transition computation and gravitational wave spectrum calculation in a minimal dark photon model.
