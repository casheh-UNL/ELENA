# ELENA: EvaLuator of tunnElliNg Actions

A software for fast and precise computation of first order phase transitions and gravitational waves production in particle physics models.

## Overview

ELENA is an open-source Python package designed to compute the full evolution of first-order phase transitions in the early universe generated by particle physics models. The core is based on a vectorized implementation of the tunnelling potential formalism for fast computation of finite-temperature tunnelling actions and resulting gravitational wave spectra.

## Features

- Fast computation of finite-temperature tunnelling actions using vectorized implementation
- Full evolution tracking of first-order phase transitions
- Computation of critical temperatures (nucleation, percolation, completion)
- Gravitational wave spectrum calculation
- Complete chain from Lagrangian parameters to GW spectrum

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/elena
cd elena
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from model import model
from espinosa import Vt_vec
from GWparams import GW_SuperCooled

# Define model parameters
lambda_ = 6e-3
g = 0.74988
vev = 500  # MeV
units = "MeV"

# Create model instance
dp = model(vev, lambda_, g)
V = dp.DVtot
dV = dp.gradV

# Compute tunnelling action at temperature T
T = 400  # MeV
instance = Vt_vec(T, V, dV)
action_over_T = instance.action_over_T

# Compute gravitational wave spectrum
gw_spectrum = GW_SuperCooled(T_star, alpha, alpha_inf, alpha_eq, 
                            R_star, gamma_star, H_star, units=units)
```

## Examples

See the `examples/phase_transition.ipynb` notebook for a complete demonstration of the full phase transition computation and gravitational wave spectrum calculation in a minimal dark photon model.
