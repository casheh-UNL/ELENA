This is a directory containing the data files required for github.com/astrolamb/ceffyl, based on free spectrum analyses of the NANOGrav 15-year data set using enterprise (see NANOGrav release https://iopscience.iop.org/collections/apjl-230623-245-Focus-on-NANOGrav-15-year)

Analyses conducted by William G. Lamb (william.g.lamb@vanderbilt.edu)

Details on how these kernel density estimations were created can be found in Lamb et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.103019)

-   30f_fs{cp}_ceffyl is a representation of a 30 frequency CURN free spectrum

-   30f_fs{hd}_ceffyl is a representation of a 30 frequency HD-correlated free spectrum

-   30f_fs{hd+mp+dp}_ceffyl_hd-only is a representation of an analysis that simultaneously modeled a HD-correlated free spectrum, a MP-correlated free spectrum, and a DP-correlated free spectrum. Only the HD component is represented here.
